      <p>
        David is a student with a strong interest in computers, programming, and building things that actually work. He spends most of his time experimenting
        with code, designing websites, and exploring how data and AI can be used to solve real problems—especially in areas like finance and automation.
        When he’s not debugging something that “should’ve worked,” he’s probably learning a new tool, pushing projects to GitHub, or refining ideas into
        something better than the last version. Curious by default, hands-on by choice, and always improving. Also a fan of cats, because obviously.

        <p>
          I enjoy exploring business ideas, building mini websites, and experimenting with tech tools like spreadsheets and design apps. Outside of class, I like
          photography, basketball, and helping friends with creative projects.

          My goal is to improve my presentation skills, learn how to build full websites, and understand how entrepreneurs turn ideas into real businesses.
