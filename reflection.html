            Reflection helps me track growth, notice patterns, and improve how I
            solve problems. I add a new entry after major assignments or units.

          <h2>Skills I Track</h2>
          <p>
            Teamwork, communication, technical thinking, and problem-solving are core
            skills in BEM1O. I look for evidence of progress in each reflection.

              <strong>What did I learn?</strong> I learned how to keep navigation consistent and how CSS
              can create a clean visual system.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>What went well?</strong> Planning the layout first made the build process smoother.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>What was challenging?</strong> Debugging spacing issues took time, but I solved it by
              testing one section at a time.

              <strong>What went well?</strong> Organizing sources and staying focused helped me finish early.
